## Using the code example


### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*)

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target)

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**

      > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box

      > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process

</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-ce241259-mdma-2d-transfer](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ce241259-mdma-2d-transfer)" application with the desired name "Mdma2dtransfer" configured for the *KIT_T2G_C-2D-6M_LITE* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_T2G_C-2D-6M_LITE --app-id mtb-example-ce241259-mdma-2d-transfer --user-app-name Mdma2dtransfer --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>

## Design and implementation

This design consists of M-DMA, a user button1. The M-DMA is set to initiate transfers by software triggers. Pressing the user button1 generates an interrupt. When an interrupt occurs, M-DMA transfer is triggered by software. Then, M-DMA transfers data from a source address to a destination address.

The transmitted data are composed of 16 bytes on code flash memory and transferred to UART TX FIFO using 2D transfer in descriptor. The terminal software connected to the KitProg3 COM port will print out the data transferred. 

This 2D transfer is configured as do X-loop four times and Y-loop is configured as do four times by one trigger. 

**STDOUT**

At all steps, current information is printed onto UART and can be read via the terminal program.

Initialization of the GPIO for UART is done in the [cy_retarget_io_init()](https://infineon.github.io/retarget-io/html/group__group__board__libs.html#ga4905a76eaea9b40111887f5b6ff7d252) function.
- Initializes the pin specified by *CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_TX* as UART TX and the pin specified by *CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_RX* as UART RX (these pins are connected to the KitProg3 COM port)
- The serial port parameters are 8N1 and 115200 baud


**M-DMA**

To configure M-DMA, the Device Configurator is used.

**Figure 2. Device configurator for M-DMA**
   
<img src="images/device_configurator_mdma1.png" width="1024"/>

As a resource, the "DMA Controller" is chosen, which is synonymous with M-DMA. "DMA DataWire 0" and "DMA DataWire 1" reflect the two P-DMA controllers available on this device.

When configuring the DMA, specify **Trigger Input**, which is used to trigger other peripherals via the trigger multiplexer available on TRAVEO&trade; T2G MCU. In this example, the transfer is started in GPIO interrupt by pressing user button1. 

Further, specify one or multiple descriptors. A descriptor is a small part of memory for the DMA to keep track of the current state (like the current source address). As descriptor chaining is supported, specify more than one. In this example, only one is used.

In the descriptor configuration, only the data transfer width is important in this example because 32-bit words are used. 

In the X-loop settings, four elements are specified to transfer. In the Y-loop settings, the number of X-loops is set to 4. Then the source address and destination address are incremented three times from their initial values. As a result, this transfers a total of 16 bytes of data from the source address on code flash to the destination address on SRAM as shown in **Figure 2**. 

The configuration is stored in flash because it will not be changed in the code.

When finished, the configurator provides the following values: 
- *MDMA_Descriptor_0* of type [cy_stc_dmac_descriptor_t](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/structcy__stc__dmac__descriptor__t.html)
- *MDMA_Descriptor_0_config* of type [cy_stc_dmac_descriptor_config_t](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/structcy__stc__dmac__descriptor__config__t.html)
- *MDMA_CHANNEL* of type [cy_stc_dmac_channel_config_t](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/structcy__stc__dmac__channel__config__t.html)
- *MDMA_HW* macro
- *MDMA_CHANNEL* macro

The above have to be used in conjunction with the right functions, as demonstrated in the code. 

**Trigger DMA via software**

To start the DMA transfer via software, manually trigger via **Trigger Multiplexer** (TrigMUX). In the PDL, the [Cy_TrigMux_SwTrigger()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__trigmux.html#ga882218319ecd105dede8b382e9a1c4a4) function is available. See the device datasheet for the trigger line corresponding to the used DMA channel.

**Transfer finish**

To see if the transfer is finished, check the status via [Cy_DMAC_Channel_GetInterruptStatusMasked()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__dmac__channel__functions.html#ga586bd262ab7725b4588dde9516c88b1e) by [CY_DMAC_INTR_COMPLETION](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__dmac__macros__interrupt__masks.html#gafdba1f920225bf6f028437646a5613a0).
